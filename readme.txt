Code Louisville Project Front End

My project is intended to replace my company's current website, www.mvisions.com. My project is unfinished and minimalistic, but meets requirements.
I used flexbox and bootstrap from most of the styling. I experimented with an open sourced carousel, flickity. My intentions was to have it link to other webpages,
but it wasn’t working out very well. It is hidden on mobile. The only javascript function is activated when you press the signup button.
It will activate what w3 called a snackbar type notification. The Lorem Ipsum is Bob Ross quotes. Since the other pages are unfinished, I replaced 
all the hrefs in the navbar to "#". I’m not very creative or good with aesthetics. I wasn’t aware that I had to go through front-end before I could take other classes.
I am really looking forward to the .net class in August. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn with CodeLouisville.
